# Quick Sort Program in Java

This program demonstrates the Quick Sort algorithm in Java, an efficient sorting technique commonly used for arranging elements in ascending order. It takes an array of integers and sorts it by partitioning and recursively sorting subarrays around a pivot element.

## Overview

The Quick Sort algorithm is a popular sorting approach based on the divide-and-conquer method. In this program:
- A **pivot** element is selected from the array.
- Elements less than the pivot are moved to its left, and elements greater are moved to its right.
- The array is recursively sorted in subarrays until all elements are in order.

## Features

- **Efficient Sorting**: Quick Sort is generally faster than other sorting algorithms for large datasets.
- **Recursive Approach**: The sorting logic is applied recursively to each divided part of the array.
- **Example Output**: When run, the program outputs the sorted version of the initial array.

## Requirements

- **Java Environment**: Requires Java to compile and execute the program.
